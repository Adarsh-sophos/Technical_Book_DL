# Technical_Book_DL

This note presents in a technical though hopefully pedagogical way the three most common forms of neural network architectures: Feedforward, Convolutional and Recurrent.

For each network, their fundamental building blocks are detailed. The forward pass and the update rules for the backpropagation algorithm are then derived in full.

The pdf of the whole document canb download directly: White_book.pdf.

Otherwise, all the figures contained in the note are joined in this repo, as well as the tex files. 

Hope it can help others!
